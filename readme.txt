<= Relight Build Tool (RBT) Beta =>

RBT Beta is a repo that host's early versions of RelightBuildTool 1.0 release

This repo is seperated from Relight Engine's repository as the current state is currently incomplete

Unlike Most of the program, which is taking insparation of UE 5.3's Source code, we are using UE 4 instead, for simplicity sake

Current program-wide TODO list:

1. Doesn't launch yet, nowhere near done currently

2. Test mode is incomplete, no way of testing

3. Ensure that this program is safe, and doesn't corrupt any data (unlikely but safeguards is recommended anyways)

4. ALWAYS ensure that no code is copied, make sure it's unique enough, remember, code is copyrighted, but knowledge is free!
(We are using python anyways, it's impossible, but do some extra stuff anyways to ensure no copyright infringement!)

Feel free to contribute as needed!
